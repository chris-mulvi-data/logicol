# logicol

Logicol stands for LOG In COLor.  It is a wrapper around the build-in `log` module to add some color highlighting to log messages.

I wrote this package for the sole purpose of playing around.  I'm sure there are formatting options that could be added to `log` that I was too lazy to read into how I could to.  Instead I wrote a little bit of code.  It really served as a learning experience as well.

Do with it as you please.  I'll probably break things a few times so sorry for that in advance.  I also may succumb to my ADHD and abandon it completely at some point too.
